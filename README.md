For this project we were supposed to design a sign-in form.
I've been watching Bojack Horseman recently, and I also came across something called "Parallax effect" while browsing the web, and I felt it would be a great idea (and ambitious) to try and implement some form of parallax effect on the project.

Granted, the main "sign-in" idea had to be redesigned, but I'm happy with the end-product.

It was a great experience because I also had to design every layer for the parallax effect to work, so I had to expand my toolkit a little bit.
